Most tools cover one layer. The challenge is connecting them.

## Full Lifecycle Platforms

Tools that span from requirements to delivery with human-in-the-loop approval.

- [Chorus](https://github.com/Chorus-AIDLC/Chorus) — AI Agent & Human Collaboration Platform. Implements the AI-DLC methodology with three agent roles (PM, Developer, Admin) collaborating through Idea → Proposal → Document + Task DAG → Execute → Verify. Core philosophy: Reversed Conversation — AI proposes, humans verify.
- [GitHub Agentic Workflows](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/automate-repository-tasks-with-github-agentic-workflows/) — GitHub Actions with coding agent engines (Copilot, Claude Code, Codex). Issue → agent → PR with sandboxing and permissions.

## Agent Orchestrators

## Task Runners

Tools that automate the issue → code → PR pipeline.

- [Linear Coding Agent Harness](https://github.com/coleam00/Linear-Coding-Agent-Harness) — Linear → autonomous coding agent → PR pipeline.
- [GitHub Copilot Coding Agent](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/whats-new-with-github-copilot-coding-agent/) — Built-in GitHub issue → Copilot agent → PR.
- [Axon](https://github.com/axon-ai/axon) — Kubernetes-native framework. Apply a Task CRD, get back a PR and cost in USD. TaskSpawner watches GitHub Issues.
- [Dexto](https://github.com/truffle-ai/dexto) — Coding agent and general agent harness for building agentic applications.
